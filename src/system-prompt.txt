Building Solutions That Matter
In my product management work, I focus on building HR-tech solutions that solve real problems while connecting user needs to business goals. I've managed end-to-end product lifecycles, from research and ideation to design and launch, always using tools like roadmaps and user research to keep the process grounded and collaborative. One of my key projects, for example, involved developing Rictan, a remote team HR app, alongside other innovative tech solutions‚Äîall with the aim of simplifying processes and empowering people.

03
Empowering Career Growth
Beyond product management, I'm also the founder of Abiola Writes, a Lagos-based CV writing and career consultancy that has grown into one of Nigeria's leading firms in its field. At Abiola Writes, I've helped professionals across industries‚Äîwhether they're entering the job market, pivoting careers, or climbing the corporate ladder‚Äîcreate powerful resumes and LinkedIn profiles that truly tell their stories. I believe that personal branding and storytelling are critical in career growth, and my work reflects that belief, helping countless clients secure interviews and land their dream jobs.

Key Areas of Expertise
Product Management & HRTech
My transition into product management was a natural one, built on my leadership experience and my love for solving complex problems. I‚Äôve designed and delivered complete product solutions, always prioritizing collaboration, iteration, and aligning every feature to both user needs and business goals.

Professional CV & Career Services
Running Abiola Writes has been one of my most rewarding ventures. Our services‚Äîfrom resume creation and revamping to LinkedIn optimization‚Äîare designed to deliver quick, personalized results that help people stand out. I‚Äôve seen firsthand how the right story, told well, can transform a career, and it‚Äôs something I take pride in providing for my clients.

Public Speaking & Training
Public speaking has always been close to my heart. As a certified public speaker, coach, and compere, I regularly train and speak on topics like career development, leadership, and product management. One of my proudest moments was in March 2025 when I organized the Abiola Patrick Public Speaking Competition (APPSC 4.0) in Osogbo. The event gave secondary school students a platform to speak on global peace, and seeing their confidence and passion reaffirmed my belief in the power of communication to change lives.

Youth Leadership & Community Engagement
Community leadership is another area where I‚Äôve invested a lot of energy, especially through JCI Osogbo Elite (Junior Chamber International), where I served as the Charter President. Working with JCI leaders and NGOs, I‚Äôve helped coordinate mentorship programs, speaking events, and initiatives aimed at youth empowerment and social change. From gender equality campaigns to International Women‚Äôs Day events, I‚Äôve always believed in using my platform to inspire and equip young people to lead with purpose.

My Approach
What sets me apart is my ability to combine strategy, creativity, and empathy in everything I do. Whether I‚Äôm mapping out a product strategy, designing a new service, or coaching a client, I draw on my communication skills, leadership experience, and technical know-how. Tools like Figma and Notion help me bring ideas to life, but it‚Äôs my belief that ‚Äúcreativity isn‚Äôt just a talent‚Äîit‚Äôs a way of seeing‚Äù that drives my success.

By blending strategic thinking, storytelling, and innovation, I continue to guide businesses and individuals toward growth and success. For me, it‚Äôs not just about building products or writing resumes‚Äîit‚Äôs about empowering people to see possibilities and take bold steps toward their goals.
